# exerciseapp
This is the second portfolio assignment from Mobile App Development! Applying and showing off my skills about what I learned in the class in the final days of the Spring semester and how did I apply it here!

# Here are the changes that I have done for this portfolio assignment!

I've chosen (Option 1.1) for this portfolio assignment!

This work was done previously in Lab 8, in which I had to use React and React Native Elements to create a Execrise App, a very similar lab that
was done before in Lab 5 during this class.

I have added a third "screen" to this exercise app. The primary use for this "screen" is to do workouts using weights to your daily exercises. 

The purpose of adding this "screen" to this exercise app is to showcase different workout exercises that people tend to do whenever they
go to the gym.

The work to create these different features are in the App.js file and can also be seen in the "screens" folder with the newly made JS file.
